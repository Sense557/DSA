<!-- 1. What are iterative Statements/Loops ?
2. Types of Loops   
    -3 TYpes
        --While
        --Do-while
        --For
3. Print the 1st n natural numbers where n is the input
4. Print the sum of the 1st n natural numbers where n is the input
5. For Loop
                1️⃣            2️⃣,5️⃣,8️⃣         4️⃣,7️⃣
        - for(init Statement; condition; final-Expression){
                3️⃣,6️⃣,9️⃣....
            //code
        }

        --> Initialization will not reapeat more than once
        --> init St. > condition > code > final-expression > condition > code >......

        Note-
            -> Everything in the for loop is optional except ";"
            -> if u only use this semi-colon then u will get trapped in the infinite loop
            -> if we don't want to get trapped then donot remove the condition part only 

6. Print 1-10 using for loop
7. Print sum of 1-10 using for loop
8. /**
    *  DO WHILE LOOP
    *      - do{
    *          //code
    *          }while(condition);
    */

9. Print the sum of stream of integers in the input
    i.e. take the user input and start adding until user gave the input "-1".

10. In do-while loop it will print the do part anyhow if it shouln't 

11. /**
    *  HOMEWORK--
    *      -> repeat the above do-while example using break keyword
    *  
    * 
    *  Break--> Stop all the iteration, donot move to the next iteration
    *  Continue --> Stop all the iteration, move to the next iteration
    */

12. If loop satisfies the condition it will break the loop and print the elements it has stored

13. Print the 1st multiple of 5 which id also a multiple of 7

14. Print all the values between 1-50 except for the multiples of 3

15. In the while loop We have to write num++ explictly twice to move to the next iteration 
    But we don't have to write it in the for loop other than once

16. 
    /**
    *  Using labels with continue & break keyword
    *      - Below only showing how can we use it 
    *      - just to know it is a cool feature so 
    * 
    */

17. Just to know as it is a cool feature to know
